USER MANUAL

- To start, set up a java application with the repository provided here:
  https://github.com/francxx96/ExamProject
  However set it up in intellij IDE and with postgres as a database

- Set up a Tomcat server for that application
  intellij has a plugin you can download for tomcat

- Create a Postgres database

- Create the following tables in the database:

CREATE TABLE users (
 name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 surname varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 email varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 password varchar(100) NOT NULL,
 lastlogin timestamp NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT user_PK PRIMARY KEY (email)
);

CREATE TABLE mail (
 sender varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 receiver varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 subject varchar(100) NULL,
 body text NOT NULL,
 aesKeyR text NOT NULL,
 aesKeyS text NOT NULL,
 time timestamp NOT NULL,
 signature text NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT mail_FK FOREIGN KEY (sender) REFERENCES users (email),
 CONSTRAINT mail_FK_1 FOREIGN KEY (receiver) REFERENCES users(email)
);

- Now, go to the repository:

https://github.com/michelefiorese/InformationSecurityProject

- Here you will find 4 java files you will have to put in your project replacing the already present files
  These 4 files will have to go under:
  src/main/java inside your project

- Before using the application you have to do a few changes:
  first off, go to your desktop and create a folder called "PrivateKeys"
  then go to the various files of the application and substitute your path everywhere you see
  "/Users/.../Desktop/PrivateKeys/" with the path to the folder you just created.
  (it is in 3 different locations in total: once in each file except the LoginServlet)

- At the top of each java file you should substitute the credentials for your database connection.

- At this point you should be able to run the application and use it on your browsers.
  If you have any trouble setting it up, contact us
